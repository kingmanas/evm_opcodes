## **🛠 Setup**

Follow these steps to get started with BlockBuddy's EVM opcode journey:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/evm-opcodes-blockbuddy
   cd evm-opcodes-blockbuddy
   ```
2. Install Foundry:
   ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    foundryup
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```
 ## 📚 Examples
 ### 1. PUSH and POP
  Learn how to manipulate the stack with ease:

  ```huff
  #define macro PUSH_POP() = takes(0) returns(1) {
    0x42 // Push 42 onto the stack
    POP  // Remove it
  }
```
### 2. GAS Optimization
Save precious gas with Yul:

   ```yul
function optimize() -> result {
    let x := 42
    result := add(x, 0)
}
```
